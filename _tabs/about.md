**Hi, I'm Riad**

I'm an aspiring `penetration tester` with a deep passion for cybersecurity. I created this blog to share that interest with you and to keep myself motivated to learn new things.

### Professional Role
I'm a recent graduate from university with a master’s in cybersecurity, and I’m currently working as a `SOC analyst`.

### About This Site
As I mentioned earlier, I created this blog to share my passion for cybersecurity with you. Here, I’ll be regularly posting write-ups for CTF challenges, tutorials, tips and tricks, and sharing resources.
